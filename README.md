# Datamon

Datamon is an Angular app that shows Pokémon data in a neat table with a detailed view option. It’s all about pulling in data from external APIs and making it easy to browse through using Angular components. This project is a great example of how to work with APIs, use external libraries, and build a smooth, interactive interface with Angular. Perfect for showing off your front-end skills!

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  
- Start the development server:

  ```bash
  ng serve


- Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to see the application running.

### Notes

If I had more time, I would have added the following features:

- **Loading Spinner:** Display a spinner while data is being loaded.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage API and data issues.
- **Type Filters:** Add filters to sort Pokémon by types.
- **RXJS Streams:** Incorporate RXJS streams for better data management and real-time updates.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for API URLs to make the configuration more flexible.
- **API Exploration:** Dive deeper into the API to refine and optimize the detailed view.
- **UI Enhancements:** Further improve the user interface for a more polished look.
- **Template Organization:** Separate templates into individual files for better maintainability.
